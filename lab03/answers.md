```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
# paste code here
imcdonal@Edana:~/csci338/lab03-exercises$ git commit -m "add README.md to the repository"
[master (root-commit) c243735] add README.md to the repository
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output
```

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init
This initializes a new repository
* git status 
This checks the status of git, you can see files that have been added and awating commits. 
you can also see what branch youre currently on
* git add 
This adds a file to the git staging area to be committed
* git commit 
This will save the file to the repository with a message describing the change
* git log
This shows a list of commits in order
* git diff
This shows you what has changed from the previous commit to the new commit


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/isrealmcd/lab03-exercises.git
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.

1 create a merge commit
	this merges the current branch with the main branch
2 squash and merge
	this will add the 1 commit from this branch to the base branch
3 rebase and merge
	this rebases the branch so each commit then becomes the new base, so the last commit is now the new "base"
